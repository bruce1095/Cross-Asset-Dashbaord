📊 U.S. Futures Market Dashboard – Powered by Python & Data Science 🧮

🔔 I’ve been working on a set of dynamic dashboards to track key U.S. futures markets using Python. Covering a broad spectrum of asset classes, from Equities and Treasuries to Commodities and Agricultural Futures, these dashboards offer a real-time view of market movements.

💡 Key Highlights:
	•	📈 Equity Futures: S&P 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000, and MidCap 400
	•	💵 Treasury Futures: From Fed Funds to 30-Year Bonds and SOFR
	•	⚡ Energy Futures: Crude Oil (WTI & Brent), Natural Gas, Heating Oil, RBOB Gasoline
	•	💎 Metals: Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium, Copper, and Aluminum
	•	🌾 Agriculture: Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Sugar, Coffee, Cocoa, Cotton, Orange Juice, and Lumber

🚀 This dashboard empowers traders, investors, and analysts to make data-driven decisions by visualizing key futures contracts.

🎨 Tools Used:
	•	Python 🐍
	•	Matplotlib 📊
	•	Yahoo Finance API 📡
